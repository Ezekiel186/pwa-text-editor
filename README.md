# pwa-text-editor

## Description
This project was my bootcamp's fifteenth homework assignment. I did not write most of this code. We were given a lot of starting code and instructions of what to do to finish the project. I did as the instructitons said and tested it for errors in the terminal and fixed those errors. I cannot deploy this project because I am having trouble with heroku declining my debit card. i tried to find alternative website but they do not work.
        
## Usage
This app, if deployed properly, would be used to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
so that users can reliably retrieve them for later use.

## License
None
